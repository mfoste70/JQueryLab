    <h1>Howdy Howdy.</h1>
    <p>
      For my site, I intend on making a portfoilo for myself and the projects
      I've developed. I'm waffling on what specific subject to make an exhibit
      out of (my web projects or my music hobby), but I have A few site
      references/inspirations to explore. Apologies for the indecisiveness.

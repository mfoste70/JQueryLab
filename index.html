            For this temporary project, I intend on making a portfolio for
            myself and the hobbies/projects I've made developed. It is in no way
            meant to be formal or representative, but I figured this would be a
            decent enough platform to experiment with JQuery.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a future project, I'd like to put together some kind of custom
            media/file player, but who knows.

        <h3>Morning</h3>

          As the first piece I composed that got actual traction, "Morning" was
          the initial spark I needed to pursue music performance and writing to
          the extent that I have.

              Strangely enough, this piece was born from a late-night party with
              some of my old friends. We all made this horrid concoction of like
              6 Monster energy drinks a bunch of sour candy, it was vile but
              effective at fueling our "last hurrah" before going off to
              college.

              For this piece, my goal was to practice blending instruments
              beyond their typical groupings while still giving each section its
              own identity/theme.

              This piece started off as my attempt at putting my old clarinet to
              use. Surely if I wrote a piece with the clarinet at the forefront,
              I could one day learn to play it again, right? Unfortunately, I
              got carried away with all the harmonies and drama. But hey, I
              think it turned out alright.

        <h3>Rococo</h3>

          While more of an excerpt than a piece, this musical idea comes from a
          creative collaboration I was in with a few other students on campus
          where I was tasked to make something opulent, snobby, and grandiose,
          hence the title "Rococo".

          Perhaps one day I'll build this into a proper piece. One day.
